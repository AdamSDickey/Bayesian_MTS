# Bayesian MTS

This folder contains the raw data and code to reproduce the findings of the letter to the editor “Bayesian association of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) with seizure outcome” by Dickey, Vanucci and Sheth (2025).  The source data contains patient level data (seizure free or not, with or without MTS) for 12 studies included in a meta-analysis (Kohlhase et al., 2021), as well as data from the recently published LAANTERN Study (Landazuri et al., 2025). This is stored in the Excel spreadsheet “MTS and seizure freedom.xlsx.”  This is read and analyzed by the annotated RMarkdown file “BayesLetterSupp.Rmd.”  This reproduces the Bayesian meta-analysis described in the letter, which shows that the LAANTERN increases our certainty in the predictive value of MTS, despite the lack of a statistically significant association.
