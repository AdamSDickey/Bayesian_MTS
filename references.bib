	abstract = {A standard mode of inference in social and behavioral science is to establish stylized facts using statistical signiﬁcance in quantitative studies. However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and eﬀects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical signiﬁcance leads to eﬀect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open post-publication review, the design solution of devoting more eﬀort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on signiﬁcance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill eﬀects of null hypothesis signiﬁcance testing being used to study small eﬀects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

	abstract = {Background: Random-effects meta-analysis within a hierarchical normal modeling framework is commonly implemented in a wide range of evidence synthesis applications. More general problems may even be tackled when considering meta-regression approaches that in addition allow for the inclusion of studylevel covariables.
Methods: We describe the Bayesian meta-regression implementation provided in the bayesmeta R package including the choice of priors, and we illustrate its practical use.
Results: A wide range of example applications are given, such as binary and continuous covariables, subgroup analysis, indirect comparisons, and model selection. Example R code is provided.
Conclusions: The bayesmeta package provides a ﬂexible implementation. Due to the avoidance of MCMC methods, computations are fast and reproducible, facilitating quick sensitivity checks or large-scale simulation studies.},

          Low power is a problem in many fields, as underpowered studies that find a statistically significant result will exaggerate the magnitude of the observed effect size. We quantified the statistical power and magnitude error of studies of epilepsy surgery outcomes. The median power across all studies was 14\%. Studies with a median sample size or less (n{\textless}=56) and a statistically significant result exaggerated the true effect size by a factor of 5.4 (median odds ratio 9.3 vs. median true odds ratio 1.7), while the Bayesian estimate of the odds ratio only exaggerated the true effect size by a factor of 1.6 (2.7 vs. 1.7). We conclude that Bayesian estimation of odds ratio attenuates the exaggeration of significant effect sizes in underpowered studies. This approach could help improve patient counseling about the chance of seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery.
          
            SHORT SUMMARY
            We estimated the statistical power of studies predicting seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery. We exacted data from a Cochrane meta-analysis. The median power across all studies was 14\%. Studies with a median sample size or less (n{\textless}=56) and a statistically significant result exaggerated the true effect size by a factor of 5.4, while the Bayesian estimate of the odds ratio only exaggerated the true effect size by a factor of 1.6. We conclude that Bayesian estimation of odds ratios attenuates the exaggeration of significant effect sizes in underpowered studies. This result could improve patient counseling regarding epilepsy surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe seizure outcomes, procedural outcomes, and safety data of MTLE LITT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Laser Ablation of Abnormal Neurological Tissue Using Robotic NeuroBlate System (LAANTERN) is a prospective multicenter registry with up to 5 years of follow-up lasting from October 2015 to March 2023 at LAANTERN epilepsy sites, which are all level IV National Association of Epilepsy Centers in the US. Adult and pediatric LAANTERN enrollees undergoing LITT for drug-resistant MTLE with at least 6 months of follow-up were included. Those with epilepsy related to a malignant lesion were excluded. INTERVENTION LITT for drug-resistant MTLE. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographic, epilepsy, and seizure characteristics; procedural data; postsurgical seizure outcomes; safety data; and quality of life (QOL) scores were prospectively collected.
RESULTS Fifteen centers enrolled 145 patients (73 [50.3\%] female) with MTLE undergoing LITT, with 77 reaching 2-year follow-up. The mean (SD) age was 39.2 (15.4) years at time of LITT with 14 of 145 in the pediatric range (younger than 22 years). The 2 most common etiologies were mesial temporal sclerosis (n = 74) and unknown etiology or magnetic resonance imaging normal (n = 31). Mean (SD) ablation volume was 28.2 (29.8) mL. Mean (SD) surgery duration was 4.3 (2.1) hours, and mean (SD) blood loss was 22 (17.6) mL. Median (IQR) length of stay was 1 (1-3) day, and 33 patients (23\%) had no intensive care unit stay postprocedure. Median (IQR) intensive care unit time was 22 (19.2-28.8) hours. Mean (SD) discharge head pain score was 2.1 (2.6) on a 0-10 scale. Most patients (n = 140 [96.6\%]) were discharged home. Two-year seizure outcomes were 45 of 77 (58.4\%) and 44 of 77 (57.2\%) for Engel 1 and International League Against Epilepsy 1/2, respectively. No clinical characteristics were associated with seizure outcome. Adverse events were seen in 24 patients (16.5\%), most being mild and transient. Pediatric seizure outcomes were similar to adult outcomes. One-third of patients stopped or decreased their antiseizure medicines. Improvements in QOL scores were seen at almost all time points assessed.
CONCLUSIONS In the largest prospective multicenter MTLE LITT cohort, LITT was found to be well tolerated with clinically meaningful seizure outcomes and QOL improvements. These findings indicate that LITT may be considered as a treatment option for drug-resistant MTLE.},
